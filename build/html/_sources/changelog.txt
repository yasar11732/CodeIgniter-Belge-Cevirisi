Version 2.0.3
=============

Release Date: August 20, 2011

-  Security

   -  An improvement was made to the MySQL and MySQLi drivers to prevent
      exposing a potential vector for SQL injection on sites using
      multi-byte character sets in the database client connection.
      An incompatibility in PHP versions < 5.2.3 and MySQL < 5.0.7 with
      *mysql_set_charset()* creates a situation where using multi-byte
      character sets on these environments may potentially expose a SQL
      injection attack vector. Latin-1, UTF-8, and other "low ASCII"
      character sets are unaffected on all environments.

      If you are running or considering running a multi-byte character
      set for your database connection, please pay close attention to
      the server environment you are deploying on to ensure you are not
      vulnerable.

-  General Changes

   -  Fixed a bug where there was a misspelling within a code comment in
      the index.php file.
   -  Added Session Class userdata to the output profiler. Additionally,
      added a show/hide toggle on HTTP Headers, Session Data and Config
      Variables.
   -  Removed internal usage of the EXT constant.
   -  Visual updates to the welcome_message view file and default error
      templates. Thanks to `danijelb <https://bitbucket.org/danijelb>`_
      for the pull request.
   -  Added insert_batch() function to the PostgreSQL database driver.
      Thanks to epallerols for the patch.
   -  Added "application/x-csv" to mimes.php.
   -  Added CSRF protection URI whitelisting.
   -  Fixed a bug where :doc:`Email library <libraries/email>`
      attachments with a "." in the name would using invalid MIME-types.

-  Helpers

   -  Added an optional third parameter to heading() which allows adding
      html attributes to the rendered heading tag.
   -  form_open() now only adds a hidden (Cross-site Reference Forgery)
      protection field when the form's action is internal and is set to
      the post method. (Reactor #165)
   -  Re-worked plural() and singular() functions in the :doc:`Inflector
      helper <helpers/inflector_helper>` to support considerably
      more words.

-  Libraries

   -  Altered Session to use a longer match against the user_agent
      string. See upgrade notes if using database sessions.
   -  Added $this->db->set_dbprefix() to the :doc:`Database
      Driver <database/queries>`.

      item was inserted successfully.
   -  Added $this->load->get_var() to the :doc:`Loader
      library <libraries/loader>` to retrieve global vars set with
      $this->load->view() and $this->load->vars().
   -  Changed $this->db->having() to insert quotes using escape() rather
      than escape_str().

Bug fixes for 2.0.3
-------------------

-  Added ENVIRONMENT to reserved constants. (Reactor #196)
-  Changed server check to ensure SCRIPT_NAME is defined. (Reactor #57)
-  Removed APPPATH.'third_party' from the packages autoloader to negate
   needless file stats if no packages exist or if the developer does not
   load any other packages by default.
-  Fixed a bug (Reactor #231) where Sessions Library database table
   example SQL did not contain an index on last_activity. See :doc:`Upgrade
   Notes <installation/upgrade_203>`.
-  Fixed a bug (Reactor #229) where the Sessions Library example SQL in
   the documentation contained incorrect SQL.
-  Fixed a bug (Core #340) where when passing in the second parameter to
   $this->db->select(), column names in subsequent queries would not be
   properly escaped.
-  Fixed issue #199 - Attributes passed as string does not include a
   space between it and the opening tag.
-  Fixed a bug where the method $this->cart->total_items() from :doc:`Cart
   Library <libraries/cart>` now returns the sum of the quantity
   of all items in the cart instead of your total count.
-  Fixed a bug where not setting 'null' when adding fields in db_forge
   for mysql and mysqli drivers would default to NULL instead of NOT
   NULL as the docs suggest.
-  Fixed a bug where using $this->db->select_max(),
   $this->db->select_min(), etc could throw notices. Thanks to w43l for
   the patch.
-  Replace checks for STDIN with php_sapi_name() == 'cli' which on the
   whole is more reliable. This should get parameters in crontab
   working.

   -  Scaffolding, having been deprecated for a number of versions, has
      been removed.
   -  Plugins have been removed, in favor of Helpers. The CAPTCHA plugin
      has been converted to a Helper and
      :doc:`documented <./helpers/captcha_helper>`. The JavaScript
      calendar plugin was removed due to the ready availability of great
      JavaScript calendars, particularly with jQuery.

      controller sub-directory can be specified when running _GET
      strings instead of URI segments.
   -  Added ability to set "Package" paths - specific paths where the
      Loader and Config classes should try to look first for a requested
      file. This allows distribution of sub-applications with their own
      libraries, models, config files, etc. in a single "package"
      directory. See the :doc:`Loader class <libraries/loader>`
      documentation for more details.

      from $this->dbforge->modify_column()'s 2nd param if you aren't
      changing the name.

      run.
   -  Table library will generate an empty cell with a blank string, or
      NULL value.

      :doc:`Profiler <general/profiling>` output.
   -  Added Chrome and Flock to the list of detectable browsers by
      browser() in the :doc:`User Agent Class <libraries/user_agent>`.
   -  The :doc:`Unit Test Class <libraries/unit_testing>` now has an
      optional "notes" field available to it, and allows for discrete
      display of test result items using
      $this->unit->set_test_items().
   -  Added a $xss_clean class variable to the XMLRPC library, enabling
      control over the use of the Security library's xss_clean()
      method.

      example would contain a zip with "directory" and all of its
      contents.
   -  Added ability in the Image Library to handle PNG transparency for
      resize operations when using the GD lib.
   -  Modified the Session class to prevent use if no encryption key is

Version 1.7
===========

Release Date: October 23, 2008
Hg Tag: 1.7.0

-  Libraries

   -  Added a new :doc:`Form Validation
      Class <libraries/form_validation>`. It simplifies setting
      rules and field names, supports arrays as field names, allows
      groups of validation rules to be saved in a config file, and adds
      some helper functions for use in view files. **Please note that
      the old Validation class is now deprecated**. We will leave it in
      the library folder for some time so that existing applications
      that use it will not break, but you are encouraged to migrate to
      the new version.
   -  Updated the :doc:`Sessions class <libraries/sessions>` so that
      any custom data being saved gets stored to a database rather than
      the session cookie (assuming you are using a database to store
      session data), permitting much more data to be saved.
   -  Added the ability to store libraries in subdirectories within
      either the main "libraries" or the local application "libraries"
      folder. Please see the :doc:`Loader class <libraries/loader>` for
      more info.
   -  Added the ability to assign library objects to your own variable
      names when you use $this->load->library(). Please see the :doc:`Loader
      class <libraries/loader>` for more info.
   -  Added controller class/method info to :doc:`Profiler
      class <general/profiling>` and support for multiple database
      connections.
   -  Improved the "auto typography" feature and moved it out of the
      helper into its own :doc:`Typography
      Class <libraries/typography>`.
   -  Improved performance and accuracy of xss_clean(), including
      reduction of false positives on image/file tests.
   -  Improved :doc:`Parser class <./libraries/parser>` to allow
      multiple calls to the parse() function. The output of each is
      appended in the output.
   -  Added max_filename option to set a file name length limit in the
      :doc:`File Upload Class <libraries/file_uploading>`.
   -  Added set_status_header() function to :doc:`Output
      class <libraries/output>`.
   -  Modified :doc:`Pagination <libraries/pagination>` class to only
      output the "First" link when the link for page one would not be
      shown.
   -  Added support for mb_strlen in the :doc:`Form
      Validation <libraries/form_validation>` class so that
      multi-byte languages will calculate string lengths properly.

-  Database

   -  Improved Active Record class to allow full path column and table
      names: hostname.database.table.column. Also improved the alias
      handling.
   -  Improved how table and column names are escaped and prefixed. It
      now honors full path names when adding prefixes and escaping.
   -  Added Active Record caching feature to "update" and "delete"
      functions.
   -  Added removal of non-printing control characters in escape_str()
      of DB drivers that do not have native PHP escaping mechanisms
      (mssql, oci8, odbc), to avoid potential SQL errors, and possible
      sources of SQL injection.
   -  Added port support to MySQL, MySQLi, and MS SQL database drivers.
   -  Added driver name variable in each DB driver, based on bug report
      #4436.

-  Helpers

   -  Added several new "setting" functions to the :doc:`Form
      helper <helpers/form_helper>` that allow POST data to be
      retrieved and set into forms. These are intended to be used on
      their own, or with the new :doc:`Form Validation
      Class <libraries/form_validation>`.
   -  Added current_url() and uri_segments() to :doc:`URL
      helper <helpers/url_helper>`.
   -  Altered auto_link() in the :doc:`URL
      helper <helpers/url_helper>` so that email addresses with
      "+" included will be linked.
   -  Added meta() function to :doc:`HTML
      helper <helpers/html_helper>`.
   -  Improved accuracy of calculations in :doc:`Number
      helper <helpers/number_helper>`.
   -  Removed added newlines ("\\n") from most form and html helper
      functions.
   -  Tightened up validation in the :doc:`Date
      helper <helpers/date_helper>` function human_to_unix(),
      and eliminated the POSIX regex.
   -  Updated :doc:`Date helper <helpers/date_helper>` to match the
      world's current time zones and offsets.
   -  Modified url_title() in the :doc:`URL
      helper <helpers/url_helper>` to remove characters and digits
      that are part of character entities, to allow dashes, underscores,
      and periods regardless of the $separator, and to allow uppercase
      characters.
   -  Added support for arbitrary attributes in anchor_popup() of the
      :doc:`URL helper <helpers/url_helper>`.

-  Other Changes

   -  Added :doc:`PHP Style Guide <./general/styleguide>` to docs.
   -  Added sanitization in xss_clean() for a deprecated HTML tag that
      could be abused in user input in Internet Explorer.
   -  Added a few openxml document mime types, and an additional mobile
      agent to mimes.php and user_agents.php respectively.
   -  Added a file lock check during caching, before trying to write to
      the file.
   -  Modified Cookie key cleaning to unset a few troublesome key names
      that can be present in certain environments, preventing CI from
      halting execution.
   -  Changed the output of the profiler to use style attribute rather
      than clear, and added the id "codeigniter_profiler" to the
      container div.

   batches of email.
-  Deprecated the application/scripts folder. It will continue to work
   for legacy users, but it is recommended that you create your own
   :doc:`libraries <./general/libraries>` or
   :doc:`models <./general/models>` instead. It was originally added
   before CI had user libraries or models, but it's not needed anymore.
-  Deprecated the $autoload['core'] item from the autoload.php file.
   Instead, please now use: $autoload['libraries']
-  Deprecated the following database functions:
   $this->db->smart_escape_str() and $this->db->fields().

   variables to run queries with. See the Models page for details.
-  Added the ability to pass objects to the :doc:`view loading
   function <./general/views>`: $this->load->view('my_view',

-  Redesigned the :doc:`Active Record class <./database/active_record>`
   to enable more varied types of queries with simpler syntax, and
   advanced features like JOINs.
-  Added a feature to the database class that lets you run :doc:`custom
   function calls <./database/call_function>`.
-  Added support for :doc:`private functions <general/controllers>` in your
   controllers. Any controller function name that starts with an
   underscore will not be served by a URI request.
-  Added the ability to pass your own initialization parameters to your
   :doc:`custom core libraries <general/creating_libraries>` when using
   $this->load->library()

   CI\_ and all controller methods are prefixed with _ci to avoid
   controller collisions. A list of reserved function names can be
   :doc:`found here <general/controllers>`.
-  Redesigned how the "CI" super object is referenced, depending on
   whether PHP 4 or 5 is being run, since PHP 5 allows a more graceful
   way to manage objects that utilizes a bit less resources.
